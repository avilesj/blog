description: "Thoughts on software engineering and computing"
---

I knew eventually I would come around and begin my own blog to publish my general thoughts on software engineering and computing.

Last year I began to ponder the creation of this blog. I postponed it all year long debating between if I should _actually_ do it, what platform to use and what to do with it once I publish it. And yet here it is, on the first day of the year because I am a bit sick to do anything else and I already spent the day developing a script to boostrap my workspace in case I change computers or something else (unlikely for now, but it was fun!).

# "Should I _actually_ do it?"

Of course! Why not? What is there to be afraid of? Critique on the content? On the design? It doesn't matter! Once you expose yourself (as in, your thoughts) you are on the spotlight (a bit exaggerated but bear with me). Once you are under the spotlight, it's free-for-all. Some people will agree with you on things that are subjective (or could be easily perceived as subjective) others won't. Sometimes you will be flatout wrong and you will be called out immediately.

I was more affraid of the latter given a few things I've read over the years about how anyone who can code something or tweak something can start their own blog and begin spreading misinformation, be it from pure innocence or looking for a profit.

While a "personal blog" might seem like a personal space, you are still exposed to the public and search engines. _Some_ people _will_ find you and they will read _something_ from your blog. It better not be misinformative content!

# "What platform should I use?"

This one wasn't hard to choose. Just before attending [CDC 2019](https://cdc.dev) I started reading a bit of Dan Abramov's blog, [Overreacted](https://overreacted.io/). While the content was good, what impressed me was the minimalist looking blog and how fast it was to browse it. Later in CDC I attended a workshop on something called the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/). The concept is simple, deliver your content as a static set of files to capitalize CDN speeds (no wordpress or ruby or database.. essentially, no backend). There are other pros on it but that is out of scope for now.

The concept was great, the workshop was a bit _boring_ but I also found about Gatsby, a static site generator that used React as the main UI library. To me Gatsby was great since I only remember Jekyll from the early GitHub days (Yes, living under a rock) _and_ I am  using React as my main tool for UI. Finally, I was a bit familiar with Netlify already and It's perfect for this purpose.

Later on I found the same template Abramov was using and... Well, here we are, aren't we?

# "What should I do with it?"

A silly question, isn't it? _What should you do once you publish your blog?_, well post quality content of course! Write about the related topics that interest you. Share your knowledge, acquire more of it. You might stop postponing those side projects for the sake of sharing how you build them with the world.

Just like your Linux system, you _own_ this. Do what you want with it.

# Closing

Having a personal blog could be a great thing. Maybe it can become a cathartic process where I can just dump whatever has been tingling my brain and be done with it, making it a plus if someone (me included, of course) learns something during that process.
